- Use `task_subtask_assignee:name` to filter for both tasks and subtasks assigned to `name`

## Subtask Status Filter

- Use `subtask:status:DONE` or `subtask:status:2` to filter for both subtasks that are `DONE`
- Use `subtask:status:TODO` or `subtask:status:0` to filter for both subtasks that are `TODO`
- Use `subtask:status:INPROGRESS` or `subtask:status:1` to filter for both subtasks that are `INPROGRESS`
